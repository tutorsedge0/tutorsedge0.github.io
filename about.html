    <p> <strong> Hasin Raihan </strong> <br> Greetings! I am a rising senior at Stuyvesant High Schoool. My favorite subjects are math and science. I am currently learning several different coding languages (such as C# and Javascript). I am also learning how to play the piano. I look forward to passing down the knowledge I have culminated over the years. </p> 
    <p> <strong> Alif Abdullah </strong> <br> Hi! I am a rising senior at Stuyvesant High School. I am passionate about reading books, especially classical works. I am currently taking a software engineering bootcamp-style course in my spare time, and am learning a new programming language, Javascript, and foreign language, Japanese (on Duolingo). I am excited to be instructing our students. </p>
